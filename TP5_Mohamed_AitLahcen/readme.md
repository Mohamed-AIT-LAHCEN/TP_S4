How It Works
Targets for Each Exercise: Each target (exo1, exo2, etc.) compiles the corresponding .cpp file into an executable with the same name (e.g., exo1_palindrome.cpp is compiled into exo1).

Running Individual Exercises: You can now run make exo1 to compile and link exo1_palindrome.cpp into an executable named exo1. Similarly, make exo2 will compile exo2_word_frequency.cpp into exo2, and so on.

Running All Exercises: The all target compiles all exercises at once.

Example Usage
Compile and Run Exercise 1:
make exo1
./exo1


Compile and Run Exercise 2:
make exo2
./exo2


Compile All Exercises:
make all
